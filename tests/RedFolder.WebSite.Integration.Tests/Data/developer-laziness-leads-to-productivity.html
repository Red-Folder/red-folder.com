<p>I've recently been reminded of how important automation can be.</p>

<p>How important it can be to the productivity of an individual and organisation.</p>

<p>I was adding some automated tests to a product for a client of mine.</p>

<p>The tests would, whenever the product was changes, automatically run through a number of validation tests.</p>

<p>While obviously there was investment in my time to produce the tests, they could be used over and over again.</p>

<p>They provided a safety net to know if we'd unexpectedly changed something which then broken the system.</p>

<p>For the investment in those tests, they could be run over and over again with very little further effort.</p>

<p>And this speaks to the heart of a general developer philosophy of being lazy.</p>

<p>I use the term lazy rather tongue in cheek as I actually mean it as a positive term.</p>

<p>A lazy developer will not want to repeatably do the same task over and over again.</p>

<p>They are problem solvers.</p>

<p>They want new and exciting problems to solve.</p>

<p>So if faced with the same problem over and over, the developer instinct will be to automated it.</p>

<p>We touched on this during my podcast episodes 19-21 where I covered <a href="https://red-folder.com/podcasts/19-Continuous-Integration">Continuous Integration</a>, <a href="https://red-folder.com/podcasts/20-Continuous-Delivery">Deployment</a> and <a href="https://red-folder.com/podcasts/21-Continuous-Deployment">Delivery</a>.  </p>

<p>These processes come out of developer frustration of having to do the same boring tasks over and over again.</p>

<p>So rather than keep doing it; those chose to automate them.</p>

<p>And while it saved those original developers from having to repeat those boring tasks, we now benefit from those first steps.</p>

<p>Not just in saving our developers from doing many of those tasks.</p>

<p>But from those tasks being more repeatable, more reliable - less human mistakes.</p>

<p>We have auditable logs of those actions having taken place.  We can see the automated system has carried them out - along with the outcome.</p>

<p>We aren't relying on a sleepy developer in the middle of the night correctly following a checklist AND correctly recording the steps they made for audit.</p>

<p>And this same "lazy" attitude can be seen throughout the entirely of Software Development.</p>

<p>Software Developers will seek to automate those problems away so they can get to the good problem solving.</p>

<p>Be that automation of testing, deployment or countless other things.</p>

<p>If you find your developers are repeatedly doing the same tasks over and over again, then encourage them to look how to automate it away.</p>

<p>It will be better for productivity.</p>

<h2>#62: Bad for ROI: The Gantt Chart</h2>

<p>Gantt Charts are a popular tool for visualising dependencies for complex activities. </p>

<p>In this episode I discuss why the use of Gantt Charts are bad for ROI in Software Development.</p>

<h2>Free Software Development Consultancy</h2>

<p>I'd like to invite you to join the new <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8981583/">Better ROI from Software Development LinkedIn Group</a></p>

<p>I've created the group because I believe;</p>

<ol>
    <li>Every business today is a technology business</li>
    <li>At some point every business will rely on Software Development</li>
    <li>Software Development, when done well, will materially affect business outcomes</li>
    <li>Software Development can be a complex and expensive to do well</li>
    <li>There wasn't a forum for business leaders to get help</li>
</ol>

<p>And this is what the group is aiming to resolve.</p>

<p>Whatever ROI means to you and your business, I want the group to provide advice to any and all questions you may have related to achieving it through Software Development.</p>

<p>Anyone is welcome to join the group; but it is primarily aimed at those that invest in Software Development (C-level) and those that help them to achieve the best outcomes (IT Management).</p>

<p>So whether your organisation has its own mobile apps, extensive line of business systems or just a simple promotional website - I look forward to your questions.</p>

<p>Stay safe.</p>
