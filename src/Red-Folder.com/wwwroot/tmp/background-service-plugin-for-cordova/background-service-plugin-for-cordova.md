A quite note to say I've added Cordova 2.x.x support to the Background Service Plugin.  This can be found [here.](https://github.com/Red-Folder/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/Android/BackgroundService/2.0.0)

It has only been through very basic testing at this stage, and only been run against Cordova 2.0.0.

I shall be running through my previous blog postings to highlight differences over the course of the next few days.

Any feedback then please let me know so that I can improve the Plugin.
