## CSS Learning Path
I'm progressing nicely with the [CSS Learning path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/css) on Pluralsight.

I completed [CSS3 In-Depth](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/css3-in-depth/table-of-contents) last week.  A really good reminder of the power of CSS3.  I don't think there was anything new here for me - more a refresher from studying CSS3 in depth back in 2012/ 2013.

It is nice to get a reminder of just how powerful CSS really is.  It's too easy to get drawn into using JavaScript or HTML to do the work that should be done by CSS.

I've one more course to go - [Play by Play: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/play-by-play-lea-verou/table-of-contents) - which should mean that I hit my target of the end of the month.

## www.red-folder.com redesign
I've managed to update a few more pages to the new design:

* [ROI](/Projects/ROI)
* [ASP.Net Core](/Projects/AspNetCore)
* [Microservices](/Projects/Microservices)
* [Cordova/ Phonegap](/Projects/Cordova)
* And bunch of subpages (mainly off Cordova stuff)

## Akka.Net
I've been aware of Actor based frameworks for a while, but never took much of a look at them.

I've recently had a project for which I'm feeling that [Akka.net](http://getakka.net/) may be really well suited for.  I'm really impressed in how the platform provides a relatively simple method of building out concurrent and distributed applications.  While so far early days, I'd expect to spend more time with it over the coming months.

I'm also aware of [Proto.Actor](http://proto.actor/) and [Orleans](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/) in the same space, so my take a look at those as well.

## Self promotion
Ok, so released my article looking at Technical Debt last week - [ROI of Technical Debt](/blog/roi-of-technical-debt).  I've somewhat moved away from the conventional wisdom in terms of its definition.  I've expanded out the meaning to make it easier to rationalise any work to make software "optimal".

I hope to get out an article this week on Dependencies.  It's an article I've been working on since before New Year - but I seem to struggle to complete it.  Fingers crossed I can get it finally off the drawing board.
