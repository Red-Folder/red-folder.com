In my previous article [All I want for Christmas is feedback](/blog/all-i-want-for-christmas-is-feedback), I wrote about actively seeking out feedback to improve yourself professionally. I follow that theme by encouraging you to put yourself into a position where you voice an opinion to solicit feedback and thus evolve you opinion.

Part of this post if born of frustration. Over the years I've facilitated a lot of meetings and had a fair few when a room of incredibly intelligent individuals simply aren't putting forward their thoughts – largely resulting in everyone looking at each other blanking waiting for someone to provide the starting point.

Generally you only need one person to voice their option to galvanise discussion – but until then it can be painful.

(Advice to meeting facilitators; if you find yourself in a similar situation, be prepared to put your own opinion into the mix to start the conversation. Remember to put this forward as a suggestion for discussion not a foregone conclusion – think servant-leader rather than dictatorship)

Regardless of the medium (meeting, blog, forum post, etc) by putting your opinion out there, you are giving people the opportunity to provide you feedback.

Now we are all scared of being belittled for putting forward the “stupid” idea. In practice most environments are a lot more forgiving than you would initially expect. Yes you will occasionally get a less than helpful response – but it will generally be in the minority. And by sharing and getting feedback, then others will join in – and the more that everyone feels comfortable, the better the environment.

Note that if you do find that you are constantly being belittled for suggestions then talk to your line management. We should be striving for our development environments to be open inclusive spaces where open debate is encouraged.

And now the secret sauce;

You have to truly listen to the feedback … and be seen to do so.

Sometimes your opinion will be wrong. It could be a little off and small adjust makes it perfect. In other cases it could be 180 degrees in the wrong direction.

If this happens then accept it gracefully and provide appropriate thanks & credit.

Never dismiss feedback - there is always value in it somewhere.
