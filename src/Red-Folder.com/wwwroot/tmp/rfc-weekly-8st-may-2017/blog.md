Should be a quick update today.  Been very busy with the day job (my client is very luck to have me).

## Stoke-On-Tech meetup
Attended the first [Stoke-On-Tech meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Stoke-On-Tech/) last week.

Great little Meetup aimed at the good techies of Stoke On Trent.  With Stoke being my adopted home (been here over 20 years now) - I'm all for that.  So much more practical for me to attend than events in Manchester.

Normal sort of format - network over pizza & a beer and two 40-45 minutes presentations.  This first meeting had one Rasberry Pi with Azure IOT Hub and a history of AI.  Both great subjects.

Next months meeting is due to look at DevOps and Powershell - both very interesting topics to me - so really looking forward to it.

## New laptop
Slowly setting up the new laptop.  Suprising how many programs and setting I have hidden away.

Rather frustratingly, Visual Studio is determined to install 2017 - so getting 2015 installed is a little tricky.  Getting the .Net Core tools for 2015 was even harder.  But seems to be getting there.

Also took the oppertunity to try a bit of Docker.  More on this when I get chance to take a proper look.

## Blog Re-development
Bit slow going with being busy with paid work AND setting up my new laptop.

As part of setting up my laptop, I did find that there has been a change in direction for Azure Functions - a movement away from .funproj project template to a stadard class library structure.  A little bit frustrating after I'd setup Continuous Delivery for my Azure Function (which underpins the Blog Re-development).

Anyway, I've blogged about the "depreciated" method in [Azure Functions - Project References - Part 1](/blog/azure-functions-project-references-part-1).  I'll publish a part 2 once I've converted over to class library.

## Self promotion
No ROI article published last week.  I managed to get about 80% through an article - but simply ran out of time to complete.  So fingers crossed for later this week.
