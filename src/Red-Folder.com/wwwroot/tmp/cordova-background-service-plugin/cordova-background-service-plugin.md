Finally managed to update the plugin for Cordova 2.2.0

I've taken this opportunity to now separate my plugin from the main repository to my own repository (as plugin repository guidelines).

The repository can be found here: [BackgroundService Plugin Repository](https://github.com/Red-Folder/Cordova-Plugin-BackgroundService)


## Source code

I have also released the source code.  It is easier to use the .jar files from the above repository - but should you be interested then go to the [BackgroundService Plugin Source Repository](https://github.com/Red-Folder/Cordova-Plugin-BackgroundService-Source)

Please review the README.md file in source Repository on how to use the code (you need to select and rename the version relevant BackgroundService.java file).
