Largely this past week I've only really been looking into the Microsoft 70-534 - Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions exam.

(Not a that much free time this week due to having to move the son back from University)

As per last weeks update, I'm starting with the [Pluralsight Learning Path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/azure-solutions-70-534).

I've completed three more of the courses, leaving me with 2 more to go - hopefully have those covered off this week.
