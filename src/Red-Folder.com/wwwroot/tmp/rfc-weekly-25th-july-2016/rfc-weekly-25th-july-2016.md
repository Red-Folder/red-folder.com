## [EntityFramework Reverse POCO Generator](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ee4fcff9-0c4c-4179-afd9-7a2fb90f5838)
A tool that will reverse engineer an existing database into an Entity Framework Code First set of classes.

Entity Framework Code First gives a great way to control your database evolution through code (rather than having SQL scripts which you hope that someone has checked in rather than run directly against the DB).

This tool allows you to use the power and goodness of the Code First setup on an existing DB.  Great stuff.

## [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)
Free web based Visio tool.

## [Warden](https://getwarden.net/)
A .Net library to help add monitoring to your project.

One I’ve added to my every growing list to add to my projects.

## [TrackJS](https://trackjs.com/)
JavaScript library for monitoring and tracking customer encountered errors in your JavaScript app.

Seems a little expensive on the face of it – but getting the data is likely to outweigh it.

## [Microsoft Holographic Academy](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/academy)
VR (Virtual Reality), AR (Augmented Reality) &amp; MR (Mixed Reality) is really on the up.  These will be gaining a lot of ground over the next few years – not just in the traditional game space, but also in business.

Microsoft are putting a lot behind their Hololens (a VR/ AR goggle) and their holographic platform.
The Academy is one effort to onboard developers and start looking at the opportunity.

One to add to learning list.

## Shameless self-promotion
I’ve been away for a few weeks enjoying some holiday with family – thus the gap in blogs &amp; updates.

I’ve finally managed to get back to my Asp.Net Core series.  After around a three month delay, I’ve got two articles out:

* Converting to ASP.Net Core - Part 5 (/blog/converting-to-aspnet-core-part-5) – looking at WebApi
* Converting to ASP.Net Core - Part 6 (/blog/converting-to-aspnet-core-part-6) – looking at Entity Framework 7 (I think now renamed Entity Framework Core)

Up to now I’ve been working with RC1 – I’ll now spend some time moving onto the RTM version.

I’m currently working on Scrum article for my LinedIn ROI series.  I’d expect this to be split across a couple of postings as I first outline Scrum, then look at some of the benefits (and negatives) for a business trying to quantify it.
