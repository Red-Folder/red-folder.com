## www.red-folder.com design
Ok, so a little running commentary on the design.

I've updated the homepage ... lot better than the previous effort.  Still a long way to go.  I had hoped to have done similar remedial work on other key pages - but my laptop has officially died so I'm somewhat stalled for a while.

As part of the design improvement, I want to spend some time studying web design and more CSS.

Currently I'm working through the [Visual Design for the Web](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/visual-design-web-2465/table-of-contents) course on Pluralsight.

I'll then follow that with going through the [CSS Learning path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/css) on Pluralsight.  Currently, I'm rated as "Proficient" by Pluralsight

Personally however, while I feel comfortable with the mechanics of CSS and tinkering - I expect I can gain something from the path in terms of how to apply CSS better.  Or at least that is the theory.

## Shameless promotion
Finally got back to the ROI series last week.  Itâ€™s been a 2 month gap in which I've been heavily distracted.  Hopefully I can get back into the swing of it, but my time is fairly short at the moment.

[ROI of Complexity](https://www.red-folder.com/blog/roi-of-complexity) goes into how complexity has an effect on the ROI.  Most of this is fairly self-evident (although definitely missed on occasion) - it introduces the Cynefin framework - something I want to reference in future articles - thus made sense to split it out.

I hope this week to finally have a go at why Software Development isn't like building a house.  I've been looking forward to this one for a while.
