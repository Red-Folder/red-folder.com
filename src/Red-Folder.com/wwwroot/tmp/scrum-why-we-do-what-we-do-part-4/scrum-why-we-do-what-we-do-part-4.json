During the series I’ll be looking at the challenges in software development today, firstly in general and then specifically with two “traditional” approaches – waterfall and solo working.  In the final part of the series I demonstrate how Scrum works for us to address those challenges.\r\n\r\nI was motivated to produce these articles to educate our wider business.  While we have been operating in a Scrum manner for over two years, acquisition has brought many new faces to the table – many of whom are confused by the way we are working.  It’s also a great opportunity to refresh those that have been working with it for a while.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nThis final article demonstrates how Scrum works for us to resolve the challenges raised in the first three articles.  The previous three articles looked at [development in general](http://red-folder.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/scrum-why-we-do-what-we-do-part-1.html) and two traditional development methodologies – [waterfall](http://red-folder.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/scrum-why-we-do-what-we-do-part-2.html) and [solo](http://red-folder.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/scrum-why-we-do-what-we-do-part-3-solo.html).\r\n\r\nI’ll first summarise our Scrum process, then how we handle the challenges raised through this series of articles.\r\n\r\n","enabled":true,"keyWords":["IT Management","Scrum"],"redirects":[{"redirectType":301,"url":"http://blog.red-folder.com/2014/08/scrum-why-we-do-what-we-do-part-4.html","redirectByRoute":false,"redirectByParameter":true}]}
