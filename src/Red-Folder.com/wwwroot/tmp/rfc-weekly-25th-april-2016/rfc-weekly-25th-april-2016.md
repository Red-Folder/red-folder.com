## Angular Style Guides
Angular like so many technologies – especially JavaScript – provide a lot of options – possibly to many.

The Angular Style Guides aim to provide advice on a common way to use the Frameworks.  Not only do they provide an opinionated resource, they also explain why.

The Angular 1 style guide can be found [here](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).

The Angular 2 style guide is very much work in progress and can found [here](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a2/README.md).   This guide is set to evolve as experience with Angular 2 emerges.

## Shameless self-promotion
Hooray … two articles this week.  Oh the joy (even if this one is a little light);

Within my ROI series on LinkedIn, I've taken a look at the ROI of Hero Developers.  I take a look at what a Hero Developer is, why they can seem a great idea – and why it isn't always the success it can seem.  This article can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/roi-hero-developer-mark-taylor).

Finally completed the fourth article looking into Asp.Net Core.  I've had a lot of fun getting to know Gulp – it might have taken a while, but a really useful tool to have in the toolkit.  The article can be found [here](/blog/converting-to-aspnet-core-part-4)
