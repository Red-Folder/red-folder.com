## Agile Adoption
Been a lot more hands on last week - both in terms of code and process improvement.

Currently heavily involved with one of my clients in a major project - one in which there is a lot of (code & feature) changes and the introduction of many agile processes.

Given the size and complexity of this project, agile methods are great fit.  And it is really good to see the team adopting more of those agile practices.

Largely we are using Scrum like process - with MVP (Minimum Viable Product) thinking, feature slices, Continuous Integration, and automated testing to the hilt (TDD & BDD).

As I say, great start.  And I'll be rolling my sleeves up plenty over the coming weeks in assisting/ mentoring/ coaching/ and anything else that can help the team succeed.

## Azure Functions - Project References (currently) the right way
Following on from last week, I updated an Azure Function to use project references the current right way (I believe this is all due to change again in the near future - more once I see this).

I've written this up in this [article](/blog/azure-functions-project-references-part-2).

## Blog Re-development
I've done almost nothing on this since last week.  If anything the reason I'm keeping this on is so that I remind myself to get back to it.

I'm going to take a little detor to put up some Nuget packages to help with Integration Testing on Specflow & xUnit.  More on those once I've got them up.

## Self promotion
Released [ROI of the Planning Horizon- An example](/blog/roi-of-the-planning-horizon-an-example) last week.

This builds on the [previous article](/blog/roi-of-the-planning-horizon), and provides a (somewhat fictional) example of a software product over time.  Hopefully it goes someway to demonstrate why I advocate thinking about the longer term when making decisions.

To provide a tad more clarity over that, in the next article, I will revist previous articles and provide comment based on this mindset.
