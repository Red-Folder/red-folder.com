In this article, part of my series explaining better ROI from software development, I’d like to share some Spotify videos.

## TL;DR

Spotify have a focused engineering culture … they want to continue to get better and better at what they do. They are an excellent source of inspiration.

## Why Spotify?

Spotify should be recognisable to most as a global technology based brand that has grown phenomenally.

**Spotify have recognised that excellence in their development process is critical to their continued growth. They invest heavily in time, money and effort to identify what works well for them.**

The videos themselves are now somewhat dated – added back into 2014 – which for Spotify make them almost antique.

Spotify themselves will have evolved their practices beyond that of the videos – they are famous for that continual improvement. They are known in the industry for it.

They do however provide a rich source of idea for teams to explore.

Regardless of the size of your development team – be it 1 or 1000, there will be lessons to take away from these videos.

Prepare to stand on the shoulders of giants.

## Festive break

I'll be taking a break for a couple of weeks over the Christmas/ New Year period. I hope to back early Next Year with a fictional case study exploring how to reduce dependencies - a massive source of hidden cost on our projects.

For now, a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all.
