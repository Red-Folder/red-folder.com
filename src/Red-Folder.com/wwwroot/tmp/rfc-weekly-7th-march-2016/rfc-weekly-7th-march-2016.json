  "description":"This is the first of my RFC Weeklies - a summary of things that I find interesting. It is an indulgence; its the weekly update that I would like to receive. Unfortunately no-one else is producing it so I figured I best get on with it. Hopefully someone else also find useful.  This week I look at ASP.Net Core, Xamarin, Microsoft Certification retirement and Pension changes.",
