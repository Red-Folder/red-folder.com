Ok, so back again after a missing week.  Last Monday was a bank holiday for me and, if I'm honest, I forgot to post an update.

## Software Development Health Check product
I've put out a draft version of the [Health Check product](/services/healthcheck).  I posted it out to my network on LinkedIn & Twitter but didn't get much feedback.

I think I want to tidy up a bit.  Currently a bit wordy.

I then need to dip my toe in the water with some advertising.  In common with all good Lean principals, I'll see if there is any interest.  If there is great - if not, then stop investing time in it.

## Blog Re-development
Ok, so back to actively working on moving the blog content into a separate GitHub repository (currently they are part of the same GitHub repo as the website).  I'd like to have an automated pipeline to take any check-in to that Repo and deploy the blog into the website.  This is similar to how Microsoft are doing their documentation pipeline.

I had originally wanted to complete by end of April - but that simply isn't going to be realistic.  Maybe end of May - but I really don't want to rush this one.

I'm using this not just as an excuse to do more with Azure Functions - but also apply a lot more SOLID Object Orientated principals.  While SOLID, Design Pattern, Refactoring Techniques, etc are all things that I've learnt largely through osmosis - all skills can be improved by refreshing.  Thus my current book choices (see below).

Fair number of things coming out of my initial work - I'll likely blog on those separately as they pertain to MicroService development.

Hopefully I'll either provide more of an update next week or have a couple of blogs out.

## Books
Really enjoyed [Refactoring](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Technology/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491824100&sr=8-1&keywords=refactoring) by Martin Fowler.

Amazing how quickly I can get through a book if I'm engaged by it.

I've now moved onto the infamous [Design Pattern by the Gang of Four](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-patterns-elements-reusable-object-oriented-x/dp/0201633612).  For my sins, this is another book that I've never taken the time to read.  While I'm confident that I understand about 80% of the books contents - a read is well overdue.

## TypeScript
I've now completed [Advanced TypeScript](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/typescript-advanced/table-of-contents).  Which is the last of the TypeScript courses I intend to do at the moment.

I'll look to utilise this knowledge when I create multiple version of the Blog page (currently planning to do Angular 1 & 2 and React).  But I want to hold off that development until I've completed the GitHub based blog development (otherwise I'll tie myself up in knots and never completing anything).

In the meanwhile, like the reading, I'm using the time to actively improve my development skills.

I'm currently working through the [Encapsulation and SOLID course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/encapsulation-solid/table-of-contents) by Mark Seemann.  The intention is to follow that on with his [Outside-In Test-Driven Development course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/outside-in-tdd/table-of-contents).  Really recommended so far.

## Self promotion
I've now release both [part 2](/blog/roi-of-dependencies-part-2) and [part 3](/blog/roi-of-dependencies-part-3) of my ROI of Dependencies mini-series.  As I said last time - I've rather enjoyed the different approach I took to these.  Not sure I'll use for future articles though as it takes so much more effort.

I've a few thought on the next articles - planning horizons, software evolution and shadow IT.  But always open to ideas.

Hopefully have something out for Thursday.
