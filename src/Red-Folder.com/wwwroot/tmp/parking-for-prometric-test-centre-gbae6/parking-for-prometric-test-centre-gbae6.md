A quick post for anyone that have queries about parking for the Prometric test centre in Manchester;

I had a test this Saturday and found that I could park on Ohio Avenue.  Just walk to the end of the road, over the tram line and then The Victoria is right in front of you.

I've posted this because I struggled to get any advice from Prometric on where to park (could never get through to the test center by phone).

Saturday was fine for parking on Ohio Avenue, but you could you use Michigan Avenue - check Google Maps based on the postcode M50 3SP to see where these roads are in relation to The Victoria.
