## Using Word for Markdown
I love Notepad++. I love VS Code.

Neither however have the same level of comfort for article writing as Microsoft
Word.

So really interested to try out this new plugin from <http://www.writage.com>

Currently the plugin is free. I suspect once it has been perfected then there
will be a charge attached.

I plan on using of the next few articles to see if it works for me.

## Ethical Hacking progress
I’m now 89% of the [Pluralsight Ethical Hacking](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/ethical-hacking) Path.

## Contractor Process
I’ve made some updates to LinkedIn. I’ve updated red-folder.com (mainly the blog sections). And I’ve updated my CV on the job sites.

That last action generally produces a flurry of agency phone calls.

Agencies can subscribe to new or updated CVs being published – with the hope of giving them a jump on new candidates. I’ve no problem with this approach – it’s fairly proactive.

It does however generally result in a high level of low value contacts (for me and the recruiter). Part of it is because I have .Net in my CV. That drives a number of agencies to ring me before reading the CV.

It isn’t uncommon for me to receive a call from an agency who starts talking to me … only to tail off with a “oh … I see from your CV this wouldn’t be correct”.  Or even better, they ready the large agency note I put at the top of my CV just as I answer the call.

So getting my CV out now (3 weeks before contract end), then hopefully I can sort the wheat from the chaff fairly early on … or at least that is the theory.
