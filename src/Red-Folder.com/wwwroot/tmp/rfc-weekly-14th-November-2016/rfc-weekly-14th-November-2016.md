Bots framework
--------------
Attended [DotNetNorth meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DotNetNorth) on Tuesday.  Senthil Kumar talked about the Microsoft Bot Framework.  While the presentation was probably a bit long and first 3rd could have been dropped for the attending audience, it was an interesting talk.

It introduced the basic concepts behind the Microsoft Bot Framework (probably enough for an architectural overview) and the expected rise of bots.

He also touched on a number of the Microsoft cognitive services ... which if I'm honest was probably the most interesting and awaited part for the audience (including myself).

In truth, the two subjects are separate, but it is difficult to look at bots without the use of tools like cognitive services.  Although technically not needed for a bot, you will need some form if you need anything greater than a simple bot.

The December meetup looks interesting ... with a thinly veiled hint that Microsoft are to show us a HoloLens.

Skype translation
-----------------
Something Senthil mentioned in his above talk was the translation facility in Skype - something which I, and most of the audience, has failed to notice.

In the top right of Skype you have the ability to set languages for yourself and your contact.  It will then automatically make translations.

This, apparently, not only works for text but also speech (selected languages).

Acclaim badges
--------------
Microsoft have implemented a new "badge" system for its certifications.  This is being run by Acclaim (I believe part of Pearson Vue).  I assume these badges replace the previous Microsoft Certification logos.  I don't seem to have receive a MCSD: Web Applications (rather a MCSA) - I assume this is because they moving the certificates around.

Overtime, I'll probably move over to these in my CV, LinkedIn & Website.

The new badges look like this:

{ACCLAIM-APPBUILDER}
{ACCLAIM-WEBAPPLICATIONS}

Shameless self-promotion
------------------------
Last week I published [ROI of Mental Health](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/roi-mental-health-mark-taylor).  The article takes a look at mental health within software development - along with why this is important (not just from the ROI perspective).
