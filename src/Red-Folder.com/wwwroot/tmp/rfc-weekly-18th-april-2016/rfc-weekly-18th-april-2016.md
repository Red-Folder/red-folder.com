## CSS Modules
CSS Modules are mean of scoping CSS rules locally.

With CSS, one of the strengths is that styles are cascaded through the entire page structure.  This can also be one of its weaknesses on a complicated page or SPA (Single Page App) – CSS you intend for one part can bleed into another.  All fixable, but can be time consuming to track down.

CSS Modules (through the use of JavaScript) allow you to define CSS to a specific scope (set of DOM elements) – making bleed less likely.

It can also be used with PostCSS (linked to last week) as part of the CSS pipeline.

## Angular 2 learning curve
This [podcast](https://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular/085-aia-looking-at-angular-2-with-ben-nadel) talks about some of the experience of moving from Angular 1 to Angular 2.

One of the main takeaways from the discussion is that transition from 1 to 2 isn't easy.  The benefits are there, but you need to think of Angular 2 as almost a completely different framework.

## Imposter Syndrome
> “… referring to high-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud"” [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)

This really interesting [talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/impostor-syndrome) discusses the Imposter Syndrome and how and why it affects developers (or any professional for that matter).  If nothing else, it gives some great tips on public speaking.

## Angular Learning Graph
Fun little graph in this [article](http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2439-my-experience-with-angularjs---the-super-heroic-javascript-mvw-framework.htm) mapping the authors feelings about Angular during his learning curve.

Interestingly I’d expect that you’d be able use the same graph for almost every technical subject.

## Economy of keystrokes
Great [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_yj4k4QZVI) on how, as developers, we should be treating our code as human communication rather than machine instructions.

## Shameless self-promotion
Again only one article this week;

Within my ROI series on LinkedIn, I've taken a look at the ROI of Failure.  This article can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/roi-failure-mark-taylor)

The fourth article looking into Asp.Net Core is still in production.  I've got Gulp working great for my CSS – just need to do the same for my JavaScript and write it all up.
