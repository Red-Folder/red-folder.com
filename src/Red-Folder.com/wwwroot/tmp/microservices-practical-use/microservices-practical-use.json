It seems a natural progression, and culmination, of multiple architectural ideals.  For me, Microservices are more a state of mind at the moment rather than a practical implementation.  I would suspect over the coming years frameworks will be created or adapted to suit the Microservice architecture.\r\n\r\nUntil that happens, I though it would be fun to spend some time creating my own - thus giving me the opportunity to explore some of the benefits and, probably more importantly, the pitfalls.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first of a series of posts as I start to explore the the architecture.\r\n\r\n","enabled":true,"keyWords":["C#","RESTful","Microservices","WebAPI"],"redirects":[{"redirectType":301,"url":"http://blog.red-folder.com/2015/06/microservices-practical-use.html","redirectByRoute":false,"redirectByParameter":true}]}
