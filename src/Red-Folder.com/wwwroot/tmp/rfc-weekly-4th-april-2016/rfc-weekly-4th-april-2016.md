This is the next of my RFC Weeklies - a summary of things that I find interesting.  It is an indulgence; its the weekly update that I would like to receive.  Unfortunately no-one else is producing it so I figured I best get on with it.  Hopefully someone else also find useful.

## Xamarin
As anticipated, Microsoft have announced that Xamarin will be free with Visual Studio (even community edition).

Xamarin provides a framework for multi-device (think multi-phone) apps.

## [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/)
Interesting new framework for intelligent bots.  So interesting for self service
## [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)
Amazing site which is providing a really great opportunity for anyone to learn how to code.  It's all free.  It's all self paced.  It's aimed to giving practical coding &amp; team experience to anyone looking to learn to code.  I heard a [podcast](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/204-jsj-free-code-camp-with-quincy-larson) from the founder and found it incredibly inspirational.  Quincy talks about the motivation behind the site and why he founded it.

I've been interested in how we teach coding for sometime now.  With a combination of a skills shortage and so many people struggling to get started in a career, then initiatives like this are superb - really looking forward to seeing how it progresses.

In the same vein, this [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-when-i-was-learning-how-to-code-565fc9dcb329#.i4lcqxi9w) () is a nice little introduction to new (and some experienced) developers.

## [Lavish Bootstrap](http://www.lavishbootstrap.com/)
Fun little site which creates a Bootstrap colour theme from any photo you provide.  Lots of fun.

## Shameless self-promotion
Two articles again this week;

Third in the series of converting my www.red-folder.com website over to ASP.Net Core &amp; MVC 6.  Spoiler alert -> I spend a lot of it fixing a mistake I made in the second article.  All ends well with getting the site into Azure.  You can read it [here](http://red-folder.blogspot.co.uk/2016/04/converting-to-aspnet-core-part-3.html)

Within my ROI series on LinkedIn, I've taken a look at Flow &amp; Productivity.  This article can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/focus-productivity-mark-taylor).
