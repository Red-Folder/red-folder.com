I'm pleased to announce that the updates for the above Cordova versions have been released to Github.

The changes for Cordova 3.0.0 does require a change to /res/xml/config.xml - so please follow the instructions in the README

Any questions or issues, then please raise an issue in the relevant Github repository.

I should get back to my automation series in the next week or so.  It has proved a real time save in preparing the above.  Doing the above also helped me to validate (and fix) the automation steps - thus I'm likely to update the existing articles before finishing the series.
