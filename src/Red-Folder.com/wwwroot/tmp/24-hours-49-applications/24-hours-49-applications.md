I've been doing a fair amount of system support work this week as holiday cover.  Great to be using some of the rustier skills.  Occurred to be yesterday that I was using a large range of applications - so over the last 24 hours I decided to document just how many.

<ol>* Android native email client
* Android Yahoo email client
* Windows 7
* Chrome
* Blogger.com
* Eclipse
* Android SDK
* Assembla.com (online Subversion repository)
* Internet Explorer
* Jenkins CI (Continuous Integration)
* LoveFilm.com (currently working through Vikings series 1)
* ipconfig
* Visual Studio 2012 Express for Desktop
* netsh
* Jasmine BDD
* Computer Management
* Kindle (currently reading Steven Erikson's Deadhouse Gates)
* Android Gmail client
* Weight Loss Tracker (Android App)
* Windows 8
* Outlook 2013
* KeePass
* Github.com
* Office 365
* Microsoft Azure
* Online Domain Registration (renew existing domains)
* Faceook.com
* Trello.com (virtual Scrum/ Agile wallboard)
* nslookup
* ping
* System Center 2012 Data Protection Manager
* SQL Server Management studio
* Exchange 2013 Admin Center
* ADSI Edit
* Excel 2013
* Sonicwall (firewall configuration)
* Google+
* Ceequal (Time &amp; Attendance system)
* Outlook.com
* Facebook app (Android)
* Twitter app (PC)
* System Center 2012 Operations Console
* Google Analytics
* RDP
* DNS Manager (Windows)
* ADModifier.net
* ntdsutil.exe
* Server Manager
* Active Directory User and Computers
</ol>For anyone that's interested, most of the above boiled down to:
* Adding a feature to an opensource project
* Fixing hybrid configuration between Office 365 and on premise Exchange 2013
* Manually removing a legacy AD controller  

Quieter day then normal ;)
