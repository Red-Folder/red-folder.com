        <h2>Not sure if this service is right for you?</h2>
        <p>If you’ve read this far, then I’d say yes.</p>
        <p>My rough rule of thumb; if you’ve got a large dedicated Software Development function that is working well – then I’ll probably not add as much value.</p>
        <p>If however, you’d see yourself a SME whose business is not Software Development, but you rely heavily on it – then I expect <strong>I can add value</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>The fact you read this far would indicate you think you need help.</strong></p>
